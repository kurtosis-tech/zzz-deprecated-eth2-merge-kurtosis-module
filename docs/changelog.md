# TBD

### Changes
* Updated flags
* Switched to `merged` genesis state instead of `phase0`
* Removed support for mining

### Features
* Added more detailed instructions on how to submit PRs to this repo
* Hid the giant configuration behind an expandable
* A new config flag `launchAdditionalService` has been added. True by default, it controls the launch of services
additional service like Forkmon, Prometheus and Grafana, as well as the transaction spammer. Is set to false, only the
Ethereum network (EL _and_ CL nodes) are launched

### Removals
* Removed the config flag `executionLayerOnly`
* Removed the testnet-verifier, and with it its associated config params: `waitForFinalization`,
  `waitForVerifications` and `verificationsEpochLimit`

# 0.6.7

### Changes
* Upgrade to module-api-lib 0.23.0
* Uses core from the new `kurtosis-sdk` over `kurtosis-core-api-lib`

# 0.6.4
### Features
* Added the `executionLayerOnly` flag to start just the execution layer

# 0.6.3
### Changes
* Upgraded core to 1.58.3 which introduces `EnclaveContext.renderTemplate`.
* Changed the code to use the `EnclaveContext.renderTemplate` sdk call.
* Upgraded module-api-lib to 0.21.2

### Fixes

# 0.6.0
### Changes
* Upgraded core to 1.58.0
* Upgraded module-api-lib to 0.21.0

### Breaking Changes
* Upgraded core to 1.58.0
  * This changes how we archive and upload files inside a container. Adding a directory earlier would result in a nested archive with files inside a directory with the same name as the directory uploaded. Now the contents of the directory uploaded are available at root of the archive.
  * Adding the above archive would have similar nesting, but now you should be able to access files without any nesting.
  * Users of geth can now access prefunded keys at `/prefunded-keys`.
  * Users of grafana can now access config files at `/config`

# 0.4.2
### Features

* Added self-documenting code for module params

* Added a `waitForMining` property to the config, to allow users to skip the EL client mine-waiting (only useful for debugging a CL client)

### Changes
* The `WaitForBeaconClientAvailability` method also checks if the returned status is READY, which means the node is synced
* Replaced the custom implementation of the availability waiter method in Lodestar Launcher with the `WaitForBeaconClientAvailability` used for other launchers
* Set the Eth1 block time to 1 second in the CL config
* Revert back to the original Lodestar image, and comment out the `BELLATRIX_` config values for now

### Fixes
* Set the `--subscribe-all-subnets` flag equivalents on all Beacon nodes
* Generate the CL genesis files AFTER the EL network is mining, so that the CL network doesn't skip any important epochs (e.g. Altair, or merge fork) which causes it to get in a stuck state
* Removed unneeded hanging-around delay that existed in wait-for-finalization logic
* Wait until all CL nodes are up before starting to process slots
* Make forkmon respond to slots-per-epoch config changes
* Bump Lodestar wait-for-availability time up to 30s
* Don't launch Forkmon until CL genesis has been hit, due to a bug where if it receives a non-200 healthcheck status for a node then it won't ever revisit the node
